## About

This repo provides scripts to install the (Linux) kernel module **shiftfs** via dkms.

### About shiftfs

shiftfs is a kernel filesystem for the Linux kernel.   
It provides easier uid/gid-shifting for containers and can be used for example with [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) (see also: [Usecases](#usecases)).

shiftfs was made by:   
See [Credits](#credits)

* Further information on shiftfs can be found in the official LXD Forum:
https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/trying-out-shiftfs/5155

### Important Info

The official successor of shiftfs is available now, see details below.   

The original shiftfs (the version used in this repo) is still available for:

- Newer kernel versions (the end of support is unknown for now, upstream will probably announce it someday (see also: [Issue 24](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/issues/24))), including: **6.1** and more
- Longterm kernel versions: **5.15**, **5.10** and **5.4**

See **Overview of Branches/Versions** below for more information on each available version in this repo.   

#### Details about the successor for shiftfs

The new approach called "**idmapped mounts**" is natively included in recent Linux kernels (since kernel version **5.12**) - so there is no need for dkms-modules anymore.
Support for the new approach is implemented since LXD version **4.16**, and the transition is seamless, so LXD will automatically switch to the new approach, if available and all commands/options stay the same.   

**Note:** For now there are some limitations though, as only **ext4, xfs, vfat and btrfs** (since kernel version **5.15**) are supported as underlying filesystems for containers and volumes. 
**ZFS and cephfs** are planned to be supported in future kernels or seperately.   
So if you use unsupported filesystems, I recommend to use the original shiftfs for now, until support for them is included in the new approach.

### Overview of Branches/Versions

There are different versions of shiftfs.c for different kernel versions, so I cover a few of them:

Note: I only test the most recent branch regularly, all others are not regularly tested.

| Branch/Version: | For Kernel(version): | Further Notes: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [k6.1](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k6.1) | 6.1.x | Does not work with 6.0.x. |
| [k5.18](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.18) | 5.18.x, 5.19.x (and probably 6.0.x) | 5.19.x and 6.0.x are not tested. Kernel versions are deprecated upstream, see [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/). |
| [k5.17](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.17) | 5.17.x | Kernel version is deprecated upstream, see [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/). |
| [k5.16](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.16) | 5.15.x (longterm version) (and probably 5.16.x) | - |
| [k5.13](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.13) | 5.13.x (and probably 5.14.x) | Kernel versions are deprecated upstream, see [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/). |
| [k5.10](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.10) | 5.10.x (longterm version) and 5.8.x | - |
| [k5.4](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/tree/k5.4) | 5.4 (longterm version) | - |
| [Arch Linux Packages in AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&K=shiftfs) | for packages "linux" and "linux-lts" | see the AUR pages for more details. |

#### What about other kernel versions?

Other kernel versions that are newer than 5.x might work, but there is no guarantee and I will not provide that.
You have the best chances if you search inside the Ubuntu kernel repos and might find a version that matches your kernel version (e.g. [hirsute kernel repo - master next](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/hirsute/tree/fs/shiftfs.c?h=master-next) for 5.11).

shiftfs will most likely not work on kernels older than version 5.x.
Thus the only recent and active branch newer than 5 is 5.4.
See also [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/).


## Known Issues

* **Regarding Overlayfs inside a container:**
shiftfs can prevent the use of overlayfs **inside a container**.      
A usecase for this is running Docker with the overlayfs-storage driver **inside a lxd container**.   
A Kernelpatch that solves this is available, but it's not included in the mainline kernel (yet).
To my knowledge only Ubuntu included it (see [solved bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1846272)).

  For **workarounds and more information** see:
[Issue 2 of this repo](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/issues/2#issuecomment-614688392)

## Usecases

* LXD:

  How to use shiftfs with LXD is described in [my wiki](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/wiki/Use-shiftfs-in-LXD)     
  and in the official Forum of LXD: [Usecases for shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-usecases-of-shiftfs-volume-disk-share/7735) and [Trying out shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/trying-out-shiftfs/5155).
