About:
------

This repo provides scripts to install shiftfs as a (linux-)kernel module via dkms.   

_Note: shiftfs will maybe be included in the mainline kernel in the future.   
At this point (to my knowledge) only ubuntu included it in their kernel (see also: [check whether shiftfs is already included](#0-check-whether-your-kernel-already-includes-shiftfs))._

#### About shiftfs:

shiftfs is a kernel filesystem for the linux kernel.   
It provides easier uid/gid-shifting for containers and can be used for example with [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) (see also: [Usecases](#usecases)).

* Further information on shiftfs:
https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/trying-out-shiftfs/5155

* The shiftfs.c file included is from the Ubuntu Kernel repo:
https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/focal/tree/fs/shiftfs.c

Important Note:
---------------

shiftfs can prevent the use of overlayfs **inside a container**.      
A usecase for this is running **Docker inside a lxd container**.         
If you want to use overlayfs inside a container, you:   
* either need kernel patches (to my knowledge only ubuntu included them in their kernel, see: [Bugreport 1846272](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1846272)) **or**
* should not use shiftfs for now.

### Changelog:

See: [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG)


Howto:
------

### Install:

#### Requirements:
 * (Recommended) Recent Linux Kernel (>5.0)
 * dkms
 * kernel-headers (e.g. debian package (for 64-bit): linux-headers-amd64)

#### 0. Check whether your kernel already includes shiftfs:

      # modinfo shiftfs

#### 1. Download this repo:
  
 With git:

      # git clone https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms.git shiftfs-dkms


#### 2. (Optional, but recommended) Update shiftfs.c:

 The shiftfs.c included might be outdated, thus the update-script.

 Run as user:

      # ./update1


#### 3. Compile and install shiftfs with dkms:

 Run as root or with sudo:

       # make -f Makefile.dkms

 Now you can check again, whether shiftfs is activated:

       # modinfo shiftfs

### Uninstall/Remove:  

   Run as root or with sudo:

       # ./remove1
       
### Upgrade:
 
 * Uninstall/Remove the old version:

   Run as root or with sudo:

       # ./remove1

 * (Optional) Update these scripts:
   
   _Note: See [Changelog](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/blob/master/CHANGELOG) whether an update is necessary._
   
   Run as user (inside the scripts folder):
       
       # git pull origin master
 
 * Repeat Step 2. and 3.
