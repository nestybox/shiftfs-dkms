About:
------

Note: This is a special branch/version for Linux Kernel 5.8+

This repo provides scripts to install the (linux-)kernel module **shiftfs** via dkms.   

_Note: shiftfs will maybe be included in the mainline kernel in the future.   
At this point (to my knowledge) only ubuntu included it in their kernel (see also: [check whether shiftfs is already included](#0-check-whether-your-kernel-already-includes-shiftfs))._

#### About shiftfs:

shiftfs is a kernel filesystem for the linux kernel.   
It provides easier uid/gid-shifting for containers and can be used for example with [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) (see also: [Usecases](#usecases)).

shiftfs was made by: See [Section Credits](#credits).

* Further information on shiftfs:
https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/trying-out-shiftfs/5155

* The shiftfs.c file included is from the Ubuntu Kernel repo:
https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/groovy/tree/fs/shiftfs.c

 
Limitations:
---------------

* **Regarding Overlayfs inside container:**   
shiftfs can prevent the use of overlayfs **inside a container**.      
A usecase for this is running Docker with the overlayfs-storage driver **inside a lxd container**.   
A Kernelpatch that solves this is available, but it's not included in the mainline kernel (yet).      
To my knowledge only Ubuntu included it (see [solved bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1846272)).      

  For **workarounds and more information** see:

### Changelog:

See: [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG)


Howto:
------

### Install:

#### Requirements:
 * (Recommended) Recent Linux Kernel (>5.0)
 * dkms
 * kernel-headers (e.g. debian package (for 64-bit): linux-headers-amd64)

#### 0. Check whether your kernel already includes shiftfs:

      # modinfo shiftfs

#### 1. Download this repo:
  
 With git:

      # git clone https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms.git shiftfs-dkms


#### 2. (Optional, but recommended) Update shiftfs.c:

 The shiftfs.c included might be outdated, thus the update-script.

 Run as user:

      # ./update1


#### 3. Compile and install shiftfs with dkms:

 Run as root or with sudo:

       # make -f Makefile.dkms

 Now you can check again, whether shiftfs is activated:

       # modinfo shiftfs

### Uninstall/Remove:  

   Run as root or with sudo:

       # ./remove1
       
### Upgrade:
 
 * Uninstall/Remove the old version:

   Run as root or with sudo:

       # ./remove1

 * (Optional) Update these scripts:
   
   _Note: See [Changelog](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/blob/master/CHANGELOG) whether an update is necessary._
   
   Run as user (inside the scripts folder):
       
       # git pull origin master
 
 * Repeat Step 2. and 3.


Usecases:
---------

* LXD:

  How to use shiftfs with LXD is described in [my wiki](https://github.com/toby63/shiftfs-dkms/wiki/Use-shiftfs-in-LXD)     
  and in the official Forum of LXD: [Usecases for shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-usecases-of-shiftfs-volume-disk-share/7735) and [Trying out shiftfs](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/trying-out-shiftfs/5155).
